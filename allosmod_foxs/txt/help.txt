<h1>AllosMod-FoXS Help Pages</h1>
<br />
<p>
The AllosMod-FoXS server is a combination of <a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/foxs/index.html"> FoXS</a> and 
<a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/index.html"> AllosMod</a>. AllosMod is a server to sample protein conformations, which 
was originally created to study allosteric proteins. FoXS is a server to do rigid body modeling of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) 
profiles. The combined server is meant to create a user friendly way to generate structures to compare to experimental SAXS profiles. <br />
<br />
The structures that are generated are a result of an underlying energy landscape and sampling procedure. The energy landscapes are constructed 
with the assumption/hypothesis that the most stable structure for a given sequence is the native crystal structure. In some instances, there 
might be several stable structures, in which case the energy landscape should include multiple basins of attraction. AllosMod is a tool that 
allows the user to specify what structures should define the energy landscape. Crystal structures or models of protein, DNA, RNA, and sugars may be used.  <br />
<br />
There are different sampling options listed from least diverse sampling to most diverse sampling. As you go down the list, sampled structures will increasingly deviate 
from the inputted PDB files: <br />
<ul>
1) Generate static structures, using MODELLER, which are similar to the input structure <br />
<br />
2) Generate models using fast AllosMod simulations at 300 K <br />
<br />
3) Generate models using fast AllosMod simulations at temperatures between 300 and 500 K and with increased stability of secondary structure. <br />
<br />
4) Generate models that strongly deviate from the crystal structure by sampling at high temperature and with chemical frustation 
(Weinkam et al. 2009 Biochemistry, 2394-2402). Chemical frustration allows for high conformational variability in regions of the structure with buried charges.<br />

These default settings can be adjusted with more flexibility by using <a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/index.html"> AllosMod</a>, which 
allows the user to download the scripts and log files. These scripts can be ran on the user's computer using MODELLER. For help, 
click <a href="http://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/advanced.html"> here</a>. With AllosMod, you will also be able to generate 
models based on a thermodynamically well sampled energy landscape. If this energy landscape produces models that reproduce 
SAXS data, then perhaps the user can learn how the microscopic motions are relevant to the biological function of the protein.  <br />

<a><h4>Server Input</h4></a>
<ul>
Input your sequence as a string of capital letters, the same specifications used in MODELLER. Multiple chains can be specified by using a "/" 
as a separator. Support is also given for nucleic acids, cofactors, and small molecules (for more information, refer to the MODELLER 
<a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/html/file/restyp.lib"> library file</a> or 
<a href="http://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/advanced.html"> help pages</a>). For help regarding specific input fields, refer 
to the AllosMod <a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/help.cgi?type=help"> help page</a> 
(for glycosylation, click <a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/help.cgi?type=glyc"> here</a>) and the FoXS 
<a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/foxs/about.html"> help page</a>.  <br />

An example input sequence is shown below. PDB code 3L2P contains one protein chain, three DNA chains, and one ligand (represented by a "."):<br />
