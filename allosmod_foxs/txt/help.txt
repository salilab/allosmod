<p>
The AllosMod-FoXS server is a combination of <a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/foxs/index.html"> FoXS</a> and 
<a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/index.html"> AllosMod</a>. AllosMod is a server to sample protein conformations, which 
was originally created to study allosteric proteins. FoXS is a server to do rigid body modeling of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) 
profiles. The combined server is meant to create a user friendly way to generate structures to compare to experimental SAXS profiles. <br />
<br />
The structures that are generated are a result of an underlying energy landscape and sampling procedure. The energy landscapes are constructed 
with the assumption/hypothesis that the most stable structure for a given sequence is the native crystal structure. In some instances, there 
might be several stable structures, in which case the energy landscape should include multiple basins of attraction. AllosMod is a tool that 
allows the user to specify what structures should define the energy landscape. Crystal structures or models may be used.  <br />
<br />
There are different sampling options that involve increasingly longer calculations and should be approached as follows. 
First, generate comparative models of the sequence used in the experiment (i.e. using MODELLER). These 
structures will be very similar to the crystal structure (or template) and should include any missing loops or residues. Second, 
generate models consistent with the crystal structure (or template) to test if there are relevant structural changes in 
solution (using fast constant temperature molecular dynamics). Third, generate models that deviate from the crystal structure (or template) 
to test if there are significant structural changes. This procedure includes sampling at high temperatures followed by rapid cooling, which can quickly 
capture rare conformational changes. Lastly, an energy landscape could be created that, when sampled using an AllosMod 
equilibrated simulation, reproduces SAXS data. Potentially, this modeled landscape would allow the user to access microscopic motions that 
are relevant for the biological system of interest.  <br />

<a><h4>Server Input</h4></a>
<ul>
Input your sequence as a string of capital letters, the same specifications used in MODELLER. Multiple chains can be specified by using a "/" 
as a separator. Support is also given for nucleic acids, cofactors, and small molecules (for more information, click 
<a href="http://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/basic.html">here</a>). <br />
