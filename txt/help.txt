The AllosMod logo is comprised of two probability density functions that are used for the nonbonded distance 
interaction. The green probability density function translates to a single energy minima applied to the 
allosteric site. The blue probability density function translates to a double energy minima that is applied to 
the rest of the protein, i.e. the regulated region. Varying the radius of the allosteric site changes how the distance energy is distributed 
across the structure, thereby driving the simulation to sample different regions of the conformational
space relevant to the allosteric transition. See the paper for more details.

<a><h4>Input Files</h4></a>
<ul>
  <li><a id="email"><h5>Email</h5></a>
      <p>If set, a notification will be sent once the job is completed.
      </p></li><br />
  <li><a id="file"><h5>Directories zip file</h5></a>
      <p>Upload a zip file containing a set of directories for each landscape that you want to model. For an example directory, 
         click <a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/html/file/input.zip"> here</a>. 
         Each directory should contain the following files:
      </p></li>

      <p><br /><b>PDB file(s):</b> all structures used to create the energy landscape for the simulation. <br />
         <br /><b>Alignment file:</b> (align.ali) contains one entry for each PDB file. Another entry (named pm.pdb) pertains to the sequence to be simulated. 
                  This alignment file should be generated after an alignment procedure, so that all sequences are aligned as you would. 
                  Multiple chains can be specified if separated using a "/", the same specifications 
		  used in Modeller. There are many ways to create an alignment file including: 1) <a href="http://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/basic.html">Modeller</a>
		  and 2) <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/">ClustalW</a>. <br />
	 <br /><b>Structure list:</b> (list) contains a list of all PDB files used to create the energy landscape for the simulation. The first file is the 
	          ligand bound structure and is used to define interactions in the allosteric site and the regulated region. All remaining files are used 
		  to define interactions in the regulated region only. <br />
	 <br /><b>Ligand File (optional):</b> (lig.pdb) contains the structure of the ligand taken from the ligand bound structure (i.e. the first in the list file).
	          A radius (rAS) around the ligand is used to define the allosteric site. If excluded, the program will set the coordinates of lig.pdb to 
		  the center of mass of the first structure in the list file. Then, setting rAS to a large number will allow a landscape with a single energy minimum
		  corresponding to the first structure in the list file. Alternatively, setting rAS to zero will allow a landscape with multiple energy minima 
		  corresponding to the remaining structures in the list file. <br />
	 <br /><b>Input File:</b> (input.dat) contains one line per parameter as follows:
	     <br /> rAS = X <ul> Radius (in &Aring;ngstroms) around the coordinates of the ligand that will specify the allosteric site. The lig.pdb file and 
	                         the first structure in the list file are used. Therefore, it is important that lig.pdb is extracted from the first 
				 structure in the list file.</ul>
	     <br /> NTOT = X <ul> Number of distinct minima in the landscape. NTOT is typically 2 if one ligand bound and one ligand unbound structure. See paper 
                                for more details. </ul>
	     <br /> NRUNS = X <ul> Number of independent simulations to run. By default, each simulation will run for 6 ns. </ul>
	     <br /> delEmax = X <ul> (optional) is the value of the maximum energy per distance interaction, typically between 0.09 and 0.12 kcal/mol. If excluded, 
                                   the value will be assigned according to 3.6*(number of residues/number of distance interactions). See paper for more details. </ul>

<a name="output"><h4>Output</h4></a>
<p>
	The output is a zip file containing the same directories that were uploaded and subdirectories for each simulation. Each subdirectory will contain 
	a Modeller script (model_run.py), a unique starting structure (random.ini), a restraint file containing interactions that will define the energy landscape 
	(converted.rsr), log files, and other output files.
</p><br />

<a name="run"><h4>To run the simulation</h4></a>
<p>
	Three scripts within Modeller have been modified to run the the simulations: 1) automodel.py is the top level script 2) autosched.py sets up the initial 
	structure and 3) refine.py runs the equilibration and simulation trajectories. Download these scripts 
	(click <a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/html/file/modeller_scripts.zip">here</a>) 
	and move them to $MODELLER_HOME/modlib/modeller/automodel/. The scripts will not modify existing Modeller functionality. To modify the simulation 
	time and/or the simulation temperature, modify the consttemp method in refine.py. To run, go to the downloaded directories 
	and type: "$MODELLER_HOME/bin/modSVN model_run.py".
