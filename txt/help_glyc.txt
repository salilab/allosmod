<h1>AllosMod Help Page - Modeling Glycosylation </h1><br />
<p>
Protein glycosylation can be modeled as explained in this help page and in a published paper (Guttman et al. 2013 Structure). For help to model non-glycosylated proteins, click 
<a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/help.cgi?type=help"> here</a>. This tool is meant to sample the 
range of conformations accessible to sugars with minimal structural changes in the protein. Protein motions will be limited 
to loops and surface side chains. To model protein conformational change in addition to glycosylation, first run simulations 
using AllosMod and then input the trajectory snapshots to model the sugars.  <br />
<br />
The following help page is organized to run batch jobs. Each input field in single landscape mode has a corresponding file/section below. <br />

<a><h4>Server Input: Batch Mode</h4></a>
<ul>
  <li><a id="file"><h5>Directories zip file</h5></a>
      <p>Upload a zip file containing a set of directories for each glycosylated protein that you want to model. For an example directory, 
         click <a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/html/file/input_glyc.zip"> here</a>. 
         Each directory should contain the following files:
      </p></li>

      <p><br /><b>PDB file(s):</b> the template structures used to model the protein. <br />
         <br /><b>Alignment file:</b> (align.ali) contains one entry for each PDB file. Another entry (named pm.pdb) pertains to the sequence to be modeled. 
                  This alignment file should be generated after an alignment procedure, as this alignment will be used to generate restraints for modeling. 
                  Multiple chains can be specified by using a "/" as a separator, the same specifications 
		  used in MODELLER. There are many ways to create an alignment file including: 1) <a href="http://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/basic.html">MODELLER</a>
		  and 2) <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/">ClustalW</a>. <br />
		  ***<a style="color:red">WARNING</a>*** Small errors in the alignment can cause big errors during a simulation due to energy conservation problems. 
		  Make sure there are no misalignments in which adjacent residues are aligned far apart in sequence (alignment programs often do this at the beginning 	
		  or end of chains). <br />
	 <br /><b>Structure list:</b> (list) contains all PDB files used as template structures.<br />
	 <br /><b>Input file:</b> (input.dat) contains one line per parameter as follows:
	     <br /> NRUNS = X <ul> Number of models to generate. </ul> <br />
	     <br /> ATTACH_GAPS = True/False (optional) <ul> Gaps will be inserted into the alignment file at the sugar attachment sites. This allows more flexibility 
		    of the protein to accommodate the sugars (default is True) . </ul><br />
	     <br /> SAMPLING = X (optional) 
	     <ul> 
			moderate_cm - <ul> (Default) Sampling is performed using simulated annealing at moderate temperatures. The energy function for the 
			  protein is composed of restraints from MODELLER while the energy function for sugar molecules is a combination of dihedral terms from CHARMM and 
			  harmonic restraints as described in the published paper (Guttman et al. 2013 Structure). </ul><br />
	     </ul>
	     <br /> REPEAT_OPTIMIZATION = X (optional) 
	     <ul>
			is the number of optimization steps to be performed. Default is one.
	     </ul> <br />
	 <br /><b>Glycosylation file:</b> (glyc.dat, for an example click <a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/allosmod/html/file/glyc.dat"> here</a> ) 
	          contains one line per sugar monomer grouped by chains of monomers. The line with the protein-bonded monomer 
	          specifies the beginning of a chain and is followed by all monomers within the chain. Three columns define 
		  the sugar types and connectivity: 1) monomer name, 2) O1 bond type, and 3) O1 attachment residue index: <br />
		  <ul>
			<br /><b>monomer name:</b><br />
			<ul>
			    NAG - b-N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine<br />
			    NGA - b-N-Acetyl-D-Galactosamine<br />
			    GLB - b-Galactose<br />
			    FUC - a-Fucose<br />
			    MAN - a-Mannose<br />
			    BMA - b-Mannose<br />
			    NAN - a-Neuraminic acid<br />
			</ul>

			<br /><b>O1 bond type:</b><br />
			<ul>
			    NGLA or NGLB - axial or equatorial bond to ASN*<br />
			    SGPA or SGPB - bond between alpha or beta position and SER*<br />
			    TGPA or TGPB - bond between alpha or beta position and THR*<br />
			    16ab - (i) 1->6 (i-1) axial at C1 and equatorial at C6<br />
			    16fu - (i) 1->6 (i-1) axial at C1 and equatorial at C6<br />
			    14bb - (i) 1->4 (i-1) equatorial at C1 and equatorial at C4<br />
			    13ab - (i) 1->3 (i-1) axial at C1 and equatorial at C3<br />
			    13bb - (i) 1->4 (i-1) equatorial at C1 and equatorial at C3<br />
			    12aa - (i) 1->2 (i-1) axial at C1 and axial at C2<br />
			    12ba - (i) 1->2 (i-1) equatorial at C1 and axial at C2<br />
			    sa23 - og sialic acid alpha 2->3 equatorial<br />
			    sa26 - og sialic acid alpha 2->6 equatorial<br />
			    <br /><br />
			    *entry specifies the beginning of a new chain
			</ul>

			<br /><b>O1 attachment residue index:</b><br />
			<ul>
			For every new sugar chain, specify the amino acid index of the residue bound to the first O1 atom in the sugar. The amino 
			acid index must correspond to the input sequence in the alignment, i.e. the first residue in the input sequence is 1 and the Nth is N.
			For sugars within the chain, specify the index of the sugar monomer bound to the O1 atom defined as such: 
			the first listed monomer in a chain has index 1, the second listed monomer in a chain has index 2,... <br />
